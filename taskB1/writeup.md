# Task B1

For Task B1, the goal was to find the domain name of the attacker's backend site

Using the URL provided in [YOUR_FILES_ARE_SAFE.txt](YOUR_FILES_ARE_SAFE.txt), <https://avcpljorzkcmrgfm.unlockmyfiles.biz/>, not much useful information was present on the site. Using Chrome Dev Tools, a backend request to <https://svvkkrekekpuvfcl.ransommethis.net/demand?cid=45624> was made. ![request.png](/images/image1.png)

```Answer: svvkkrekekpuvfcl.ransommethis.net```
